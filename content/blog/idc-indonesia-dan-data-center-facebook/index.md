Recently, I was reading an article by **Robert Scoble** about his "tour" of Facebook's data centre. If we look at it from a grandiose perspective, it seems quite impressive when compared to IDC Indonesia's data centre for a company (Facebook).

## IDC Indonesia

Their business involves providing data centre services, where customers can store their servers within their facilities. There are various options for colocation, including renting a room or a 45U server rack. Alternatively, one can share a server rack or space with another company that has already rented a server rack or space (commonly referred to as colocation).

Indonesia has several data centre locations across the country, including Jakarta, Surabaya, Batam, Makasar, and Bandung. Personally, I have only visited IDC Jakarta Cyber (Kuningan, also known as the cyber building) and IDC Jakarta 3D (Duren Tiga).

Only individuals from companies that have contracts with IDC are authorized to enter the data centre. All items within the data centre are meticulously catalogued as assets belonging to the company that has entrusted them to IDC. Any item entering or leaving the data centre must be recorded, regardless of whether it will eventually be removed.

When we enter the data centre, the door will not open unless we possess a smart card as our access key to that area.

This room is equipped with large air conditioning (AC) and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units. The cool air circulation produced by the AC was designed to circulate hot air emitted by the machines in the room, ensuring a comfortable working environment.

## Facebook's data centre

The following is what you see when you arrive at Facebook's data centre. It's MASSIVE!

After passing by the massive Facebook logo, you'll arrive at a lobby that displays the condition of the data centre and the performance of the cooling system:

Facebook's data centre also features air filters and cooling systems that can be described as "crazy".

And finally, we arrive at Facebook's data centre rack:
