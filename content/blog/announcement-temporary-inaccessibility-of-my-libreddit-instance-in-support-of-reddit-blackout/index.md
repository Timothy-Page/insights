Dear Users,

I hope this announcement finds you well. I would like to inform you of an important decision I have made to support the **Reddit blackout movement**. In solidarity with this cause, my Libreddit instance will be inaccessible for *unknown period of time* and I will see [how it goes (Libreddit github issue #818)](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit/issues/818).

Starting **12th of June 2023**, my Libreddit instance (libreddit.ditatompel.com) will be taken offline as part of the protest against Reddit policies and [API cost changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/). During this time, I encourage you to participate in discussions and engage with other online communities to voice your concerns about the importance of an open and inclusive digital space.

I understand that this inaccessibility may cause inconvenience, and I sincerely apologize for any disruption caused to your browsing experience. I will closely monitor the situation and provide updates regarding the duration of the blackout and any developments that may arise. I appreciate your understanding and support during this crucial time.

Sincerely,

ditatompel
